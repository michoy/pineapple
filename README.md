## What is it?
Pineapple is a learning tool, designed to be used on the institution level. It's goal is to improve
awareness and understanding of where learning difficulties are located and offer help where needed.

With Pineapple students will gain the ability to anonymously compare their progress with the rest of
the class. The adaptive exercise and reading material system make sure that improvement comes easily
where it is needed most.

At the same time, lecturers are proveded with both information and tools to help steer focus to specific
topics as the class progresses. Do you teach a new course? No problem, with Pineapple you can adjust and
fix issues on the fly. Maintaining an established course? Perfect, fine-tuning has never been easier.
